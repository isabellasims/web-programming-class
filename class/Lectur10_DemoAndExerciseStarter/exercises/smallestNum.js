/**
Exercise 3:   Smallest Number  (5pts)

Write a function named findMin that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter
 and returns the smallest number in the array. For example,
 if an array variable named nums stored the following values:

    let nums = [-1, 3.2, 12, 15, -4, 1, -12.5, 1, 8];

Then the call of findMin(nums) should return -12.5 since that is the smallest numerical value in the array.
 You may assume that the array passed to your function is non-empty and contains only number types.
 To display results, you can use document.write()
 Or you can create a button to trigger your function

<button onclick=”findmin();">Click me!</button>

 **/

function findMin(nums){

    n.index(min(n))
}
