Exercise 1 JS Function  (5pts)

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
    Write a function named tellFortunethat.js:
–takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

–outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
    You can try to use Function invocation and Method invocation to solve this problem

 2B.   Click the button the red ball will bounce back and force. 

 

Exercise 3:   Smallest Number  (5pts) 

Write a function named findMin that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the smallest number in the array. For example, if an array variable named nums stored the following values:

let nums = [-1, 3.2, 12, 15, -4, 1, -12.5, 1, 8];

Then the call of findMin(nums) should return -12.5 since that is the smallest numerical value in the array.

You may assume that the array passed to your function is non-empty and contains only number types.

To display results, you can use document.write()

Or you can create a button to trigger your function

<button onclick=”findmin();">Click me!</button>

Exercise 4: Reverse a number (5pts) 

Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number. E.g: 25368 -> 86352
Step 1: Create a simple .html file.
Step 2: Write a function and save it as ReverseString.js
Step 3: link the .js into the <head></head> in your .html
First change the number to string.
Then n.split(“”).reverse().join(“”);
Again, you can create a button to trigger the function or use alter.
