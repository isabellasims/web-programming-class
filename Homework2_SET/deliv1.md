The basic rule of set is:

You take 3 cards out of 12 cards to form a “set”. A “set” consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions:

They all have the same number or have three different numbers.
They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.
They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.
They all have the same color or have three different colors.
Once the set is found, these cards are taken away from the board. You have to find the “set” from the rest of the deck. If you can’t find them anymore, you can add more cards (refreshing the board).
